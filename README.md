Interactive Quiz App

Project About - 
My Project is Interactive Quiz App.
This is the short readme that how I approach this small project.
The provided code is for a simple, mobile-responsive interactive quiz app built using html, css, and javascript.
Here's a brief description of the code:

HTML(index.html): The html file sets up the structure of the quiz app. Basically I made the structure layout 
with container, divs,buttons,basic headings. It includes a result, submit,retry button. 

CSS(style.css): The css file contains styling rules for the quiz elements. It ensures that the questions and
answer structure and buttons have an attractive layout. Quiz are arrenge with proper spacing and a hover 
effect on the submit button. Then I finish rest basic styling.


Project Approach in Javascript -

 * First I make array of objects for question, ans and correct-option. 
 * Then make a function which load the questions and objects logic used to load.
 * Then submit quiz function check the correct answer.
 * Then make a getans for the result where I loop throgh the options for calculating the ans.
 * At last I reset the quiz and retey function display new div.
